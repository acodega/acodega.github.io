My name is Adam, I&#8217;m a New England native working in the information technology field as a Macadmin. Technology is awesome, right? I have a passion for it.. I call it &#8220;Better Living Through IT&#8221;. (Hence the name of [my blog][1]) There are so many great tools and devices available for us to use in our personal and our work lives. From computers, smartphones, iPads, web apps, and more. **More then just easy to market gadgets, I&#8217;m talking about the technology that helps us communicate better and work more effectively.**

I enjoy helping to connect people with the technology to improve their lives. I currently work as an IT Specialist for a four year old tech startup. Basically, lots of MacBook Airs and Wi-Fi. In the past I&#8217;ve worked as a junior sysadmin for community college and also as a field service engineer for a local managed service provider with clients in a variety of industries.

**Things I do:** Wireless network administration, OS X deployment, PCI security, help desk management and environment documentation.

**Tools I use:** Apple OS X Betas, Google Apps for Business, [JAMF Casper Suite][2] ([and JAMF Nation][3]), a little bit of bash scripting, [Metageek survey tools][4], some OSS, [Narragansett beer][5], [1Password][6], Apple iOS, and WordPress.

I&#8217;m in a beer club at a local bar and when you finish the card that has all eighty of their bottled and draft beers, you get a special glass with your custom message etched on the back of it. I put **&#8220;Better Living Through IT&#8221;** on mine. People think it&#8217;s kind of nerdy.

I&#8217;m also a member of <a href="http://www.lopsa.org/" target="_blank">LOPSA</a>, a founding member of [LOPSA RI][7], as well as <a title="LOPSA Mentorship Program" href="https://lopsa.org/mentor" target="_blank">a mentor</a>.
