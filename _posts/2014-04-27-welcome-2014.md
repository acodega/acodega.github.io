It&#8217;s almost May, but I have to write about my changes in 2014.

In March I was hired at a four year old tech startup in Providence, RI as an IT Specialist. The company wanted to create a full-time position dedicated to internal IT. So far I&#8217;ve spent my time setting up a help desk ticket system, seeing to daily support tickets, developing an employee on-boarding and workflow, deploying [JAMF Casper Suite][1] (100% wireless Apple environment) and learning as much as I can about wireless networking.

This job has been a big shift for me, not only am I moving away from a Windows/VMware career track, I&#8217;m also in a much different office environment. It&#8217;s fast paced and very collaborative. We have a large focus on cloud services because of how fast services can get up and running and expand as needed.

The job is bringing on new challenges and a new career outlook. I&#8217;ve updated my 2014 goals (see sidebar) to cover the new technology in my daily IT life; Apple computers, Google Apps for Business and wireless networking. I&#8217;ve also been very grateful for my employer&#8217;s support in launching [LOPSA RI][2], the Rhode Island chapter of the [League Of Professional System Administrators][3]. My employer has a great event space with A/V and they even provide the beer and pizza.

This week I&#8217;m attending [LOPSA East][4], again thanks to my employer support, where I&#8217;ll be participating on the [LOPSA Mentors panel][5] talking about IT careers. (Along with soaking up as many great classes, talks, and hallway conversations as I can.) I serve as a LOPSA mentor for proteges looking to enter the IT industry or move up from an entry-level position. If you work in IT check out the mentor program, almost anyone can be a mentor and it&#8217;s incredibly rewarding to help a peer in the IT field. (and prevent another BOFH from forming..)

So, 2014 is definitely looking up. I hope to have more content to blog about through my day to day work plus the work I&#8217;m doing with LOPSA RI.
