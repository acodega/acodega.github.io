A post on the <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=16620" target="_blank">lively JAMF Nation discussion boards</a> inspired me to sum up my thoughts in a blog post.

Every year, Macadmins and <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/" target="_blank">JAMF Software</a> customers descend upon Minneapolis, MN for one of the largest Macadmin conferences, the <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnuc.html" target="_blank">JAMF Nation User Conference</a>. This year is going to be my second year attending and first year speaking. It&#8217;s a great combination of informative sessions, great networking opportunities, and plenty of after hours events. Just check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFipLtfqDqM" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s recap video</a>.

**Sessions and What To Do:** Traditionally, <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/events/jamf-nation-user-conference/2014/sessions/" target="_blank">look at last year for example</a>, the Guthrie Theater has three stages where talks happen; small, medium, and large. So there are three events going on at once with breaks in between. Use the breaks to network with other Macadmins. It&#8217;s much better than racing from one room to another. Don&#8217;t worry about the Wi-Fi working or not, you&#8217;re here to learn and build relationships. Right now (August 30th) <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/events/jamf-nation-user-conference/2015/sessions/" target="_blank">a preliminary list of sessions</a> has been released (including yours truly) and more will be coming soon, along with a schedule.

**Weather/Transportation:** I was comfortable, and a cliche Macadmin, with just my hoodie and jeans. There&#8217;s a light rail for a few dollars from the airport that will get you downtown. For Uber, the pricier Black is at the airport ($60) but around town UberX was cheap. ($6 one way) I&#8217;ve heard good things about the bike rental system <a href="https://www.niceridemn.org/" target="_blank">Nice Ride MN</a>. Fellow Macadmin <a href="http://www.modtitan.com/" target="_blank">Emily Kausalik</a> has created <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zOOGEAaSMcMM.kSly9hPPtyYM" target="_blank">a neat Google Maps</a> of sights and businesses in city.

**To bring:** A small shoulder bag for your laptop and misc, plenty of business cards (you&#8217;re here to network), and a portable battery for your iPad or iPhone.

**Misc To Do: **Be sure to give yourself time to exercise or enjoy the pool at the hotel if you&#8217;re the type, there&#8217;s also a casual 5k you&#8217;ll see on the <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnucEvents.html?type=mini" target="_blank">Mini Events page</a>. Guthrie Theater is steps away from the Aloft Hotel, you can always find Macadmins there in the evening. They have a bar and lounge along with table games and an outdoor fire pit. Also close to the Guthrie is Grumpy&#8217;s and Day Block Brewery which are great places to get food and drink. This year (2015), There&#8217;s a <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnucEvent.html?eventId=131&view=info" target="_blank">Monday night meetup at Grumpy&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://macbrained.org/" target="_blank">Macbrained</a> is having their meetup on <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnucEvent.html?eventId=135&view=info" target="_blank">Tuesday night at Day Block Brewery</a>. Again, check out the <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnucEvents.html?type=mini" target="_blank">mini events page</a> for attendee driven activities, even make your own if you want!

For sessions, come with a purpose and you&#8217;ll get the most ROI out of them. All session videos are posted later online. Pick the sessions that you think you&#8217;ll react on as soon as you get home, or those you see yourself asking questions at. When asking questions, rank them in this way:

  1. Important questions to help your understanding that you think others will benefit from hearing
  2. Questions that&#8217;d be nice to ask, especially when there aren&#8217;t many questions for the speaker
  3. Questions that aren&#8217;t really questions but you just want the microphone to make yourself sound smart

Please avoid number three.

When taking notes&#8211;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Wait.. is he really telling us how to take notes..</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yes! Good note taking makes the session more enjoyable and your post-conference to do list easier to create. For a conference like JNUC, the session videos will be posted soon after so you can always reference them in the future, so don&#8217;t worry about getting everything. Write down the title of the talk so you can search Evernote/Google Drive easily along with the author&#8217;s name so you can find them later on JAMF Nation, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Then simply write just the important bullet points under a <strong>Key Insights</strong> header, then at the end of the talk or in the evening, write an <strong>Action Items</strong> header. Actions Items are the things you&#8217;ll implement, improve, or begin doing as a result of seeing this talk. This will help when you return to the office so you can remember everything and quickly build a to do list to get to work. Often you return and quickly go back to the daily grind, not implementing the awesome ideas and practices you&#8217;ve just learned. You&#8217;ll also be able to send your manager an email showing everything you&#8217;ve learned so they can understand the ROI they&#8217;ve gained by you attending.

Most important at any conference, talk to people. We&#8217;re all here for the same reasons, solving a lot of the same problems. If you find me during the conference, be sure to say hello.
