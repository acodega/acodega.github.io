Every so often I&#8217;ll mention a piece of tech or website in a chat room or conference that I think a lot of people use and there&#8217;s always someone excited to find out about it. So in no particular order, and in an attempt to keep my blog active (Over a year between posts.. whoa), here&#8217;s three things you should know about:

  * <a style="font-style: normal;" title="/r/SysadminResumes" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadminresumes" target="_blank"><strong>/r/sysadminresumes</strong></a> Your experience and certifications are only a part of the job search battle. Your resume needs to be well written, proofread and easy to scan with your eyes. People spend only seconds looking at your resume. Submit your resume to the /r/syadminresumes subreddit or just browse the content for advice and real resume examples.
<li style="text-align: left;">
  <a title="mRemoteNG" href="http://www.mremoteng.org/" target="_blank"><strong>mRemoteNG</strong></a> If you&#8217;re using PuTTY and remote desktop sessions and you constantly have windows open everywhere, get yourself mRemoteNG. You need to work more productively! It lets you do SSH, RDP, VNC, HTTPS and more in a tabbed program with an easy to use bookmark manager that you can easily sync with your other work machines. (Just copy the XML config file) The HTTPS feature is great for all the web consoles we have nowadays.

  * <a href="http://lopsa.org" target="_blank"><strong>League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA)</strong></a> If you&#8217;re looking to get involved in the IT industry in more ways than just your current job, LOPSA is a great place to start. *&#8220;The League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA) is a nonprofit corporation with members throughout the world. Our mission is to advance the practice of system administration; to support, recognize, educate, and encourage its practitioners; and to serve the public through education and outreach on system administration issues.&#8221;* Membership is only $50 and gives you networking opportunities, local chapter meetings, some perks and discounts, as well as a yearly affordable regional conference. (<a title="Cascadia IT Conference" href="http://www.casitconf.org/" target="_blank">Cascadia IT</a> on the West coast, <a title="LOPSA East Conference" href="http://lopsaeast.org" target="_blank">LOPSA East</a> put on by the NJ chapter on the east coast. Excuse the websites, they are in the middle of a refresh period.) If you don&#8217;t have a chapter in your area that&#8217;s okay, you can still join or even start a chapter yourself! You may find people in your area waiting to start one themselves.
