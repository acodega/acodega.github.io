[Skype calls to feature ads big enough to interrupt any conversation.][1]

Skype&#8217;s Sandhya Venkatachalam, via the company blog:

> While on a 1:1 audio call, users will see content that could spark additional topics of conversation..

via [Ars Technica][2]

Here&#8217;s how I see this going down:

**Mom:** So the neighbors put in a new bird bath right next to.. wait what is this? Ford trucks? Why are you showing this?

**Me:** It&#8217;s.. it&#8217;s not me.. it&#8217;s Skype. They are doing these ads now for us to talk about. Wow.. this is annoying. Here&#8217;s a new topic of conversation.. let&#8217;s talk about how silly Skype&#8217;s new advertising model is but let&#8217;s switch to Google+ Hangout so we don&#8217;t get interrupted by an ad again.
